# Example Data for adt-explorer

This directory contains a set of example DTDL files (*.json) that you can load into into your Azure Digital Twins instance using adt-explorer. 

The twins graph created by the models and data files in this folder looks like this:

The DTDL files model a fictive energy grid. They are not intended to represent a realistic model that matches real-world entities or devices used in a real energy grid. 
They were just created to quickly test and demonstrate adt-explorer and to provide an example for a visualization. They may aslo serve as an example for DTDL syntax.

This directory also contains two spreadsheet files (*.xlsx) that you can use to create a twin graph in your Azure Digital Twins instance with adt-explorer.
See the [main readme](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/digital-twins-explorer/blob/master/README.md) for instructions. The file you want to start with is `distributionGrid.xlsx`.
